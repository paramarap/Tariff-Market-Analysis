### Market Impact of Tariffs

A Python & SQL project analyzing the stock market's reaction to past U.S. tariff events under the Trump administration. Using historical data, I examined key metrics to derive insights into the potential effects of current trade tensions.

## Project Overview
âœ… Collected and processed market data from past tariff events
âœ… Used SQL queries to extract relevant stock movement patterns
âœ… Generated a CSV file with key financial metrics
âœ… Performed data analysis to identify trends and market behavior
âœ… Provided insights on how past tariff-related market movements compare to today's trade war

## Results & Insights
ðŸ“ˆ Findings suggest that market corrections following tariffs followed a pattern of initial decline, followed by stabilization over a set period.
