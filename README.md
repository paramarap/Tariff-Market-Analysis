### Market Impact of Tariffs

A Python & SQL project analyzing the stock market's reaction to past U.S. tariff events under the Trump administration. Using historical data, I examined key metrics to derive insights into the potential effects of current trade tensions.

## Project Overview ✅
- Collected and processed market data from past tariff events
- Used SQL queries to extract relevant stock movement patterns
- Generated a CSV file with key financial metrics
- Performed data analysis to identify trends and market behavior
- Provided insights on how past tariff-related market movements compare to today's trade war

## Results & Insights
📈 Findings suggest that market corrections following tariffs followed a pattern of initial decline, followed by stabilization over a set period.
